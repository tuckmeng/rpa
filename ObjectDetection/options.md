Use Ultralytics YOLO 11 model

Ultralytics documentation supports exporting YOLO11 models to the TF.js format. 

There exists a library yoloâ€‘tfjsâ€‘vision which claims to support loading YOLO (including YOLO11) in the browser.

ðŸ›  What you can do: host your own YOLO11 TF.js model

Since I couldnâ€™t find a ready public model, hereâ€™s a plan you can follow to host one yourself:

Export YOLO11 model to TF.js
Use Ultralyticsâ€™ export tools:

yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=tfjs


This creates a directory like yolo11n_web_model/ with model.json and weight shards. 
Host that directory

Put yolo11n_web_model/ under your web serverâ€™s public folder.

Ensure itâ€™s accessible via http://yourserver/yolo11n_web_model/model.json.

Modify your frontend code
Use tf.loadGraphModel() or a wrapper (such as in yoloâ€‘tfjsâ€‘vision) to load that hosted model.json.
Then do inference, postprocess, draw results, etc.
