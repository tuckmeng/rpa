Creating a webpage that does the same Excel Spreadsheet functionality as the Linux Program.
The Javascript library used to zip up the file comes from https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js
This version only allows numbers to be put into the Excel file as the XML structure changes when strings are put in.

Updated 31/1/2025:
Created a new webpage that overcomes the technical limitations stated above. It uses https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jszip/3.10.1/jszip.min.js as the zip function. The new webpage is ss5.html.
