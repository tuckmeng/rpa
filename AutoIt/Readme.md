In this folder are the AutoIt source files which we will generate Windows and Linux equivalents without using the AutoIt compiler. This ensures that your codes are clean and you can see know what codes are running in your computer before you turn it into a binary.

Unfortunately, AutoIt Compiler does produce a file with a huge file size, so this is an attempt to shrink the file and provide visibility on the codes running.

The AutoIt source files are taken from the tutorial part of the AutoItScript website.

The inspiration for this repo came from the AutoItScript website. Compared to other RPA tools, this is the simplest and cheapest to install and use. The only negative is that it's not open source and it produces executables which are wrapped with UPX, so you don't know what is actually running on your laptop. That's fine if you run it on a virtual machine, but not such a good idea in commercial production environments. 

It doesn't help that there is malware written using AutoIt and hence it won't be surprising if your legit AutoItScript script running on your PC is identified as a malware in some future point of time.

I can't capture the screenshot for RPA2.exe as the notepad automation happens too fast, so you can download it and try it out yourself.
