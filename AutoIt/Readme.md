In this folder are the AutoIt source files which we will generate Windows and Linux equivalents without using the AutoIt compiler. This ensures that your codes are clean and you know what codes are running in your computer.

Unfortunately, AutoIt Compiler does produce a file with a huge file size, so this is an attempt to shrink the file and provide visibility on the codes running.

The AutoIt source files are taken from the tutorial part of the AutoItScript website.

The inspiration for this repo came from the AutoItScript website. Compared to other RPA tools, this is the simplest and coolest to install and use. The only negative is that it's not open source, so you need to trust that the tool is legit when you use it.
